# PodcastChaptersConverter
Converts "MP4 Chaps" (Podlove Plugin) to "CUE" (Podcast Chapters App)

The  Desktop-Version of Auphonic does not offer MP3 Chapter Marks.
You can use [Podcast Chapters](http://chaptersapp.com/) for that. But then you have to enter your chapter marks into both:
1. the Podlove Plugin, 2. Podcast Chapters App.

This little tool takes the "MP4 Chaps export (TXT)" of the podlove plugin and converts it into the "CUE Format" 
for import into the Podcast Chapters App.
